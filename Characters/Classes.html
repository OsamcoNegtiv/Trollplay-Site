  <div class="section">
    <p>The Six Major Functions that the classes represent, or in other terms, the 6 possible ways of interacting with any given object, situation or environment. And these are Manipulation, Comprehension, Creation, Destruction, Application and Relocation.</p>

    <p>Creation is defined as the act of bringing into existence an object, environment or situation that wasn't there before.</p>

    <p>Destruction is defined as the act of taking out of existence an object, environment or situation that was there before.</p>

    <p>Manipulation is defined as the act of changing the properties of any given object, environment or situation.</p>

    <p>Comprehension is defined as the act of truly understanding all information about any given object, environment or situation.</p>

    <p>Relocation is defined as the act of moving or relocating any given object, environment or situation, or something within any given environment or situation, from one place to another.</p>

    <p>Application is defined as the act of using any given object, environment or situation for its intended or pre-determined purpose, or using any given object, environment or situation on another object, environment or situation.</p>

    <p>And these interact with each other in 3 inextricable pairs: Creation/Destruction. Manipulation/Comprehension. And Application/Relocation.</p>

    <p>And this is because you are always simultaneously doing both actions when you do one action in a pair, per the idea of every action having an equal and opposite reaction. I go into that a lil deeper in this post <a href="http://dahniwitchoflight.tumblr.com/post/116136400217" title="dahniwitchoflight">Here</a>.</p>
	
    <p>But to paraphrase that post sort of:</p>
	
	<p>1)      Every time you create 'something', you are destroying the 'nothing' that once existed there, every time you create a 'nothing' you are destroying the 'something' that was once there.</p>

    <p>2)      Every time you change 'something', you also change what you now know about that thing. Every time you learn something new about 'something', it changes the ways and things, you can change and manipulate about, that thing. (not to mention in one meaning of 'manipulation', it often involves a withholding of true information, being manipulated and having a true understanding of something are opposed in nature as well)</p>

    <p>3)      Every time you apply 'something' to 'something else' there is always a function of movement involved, turning a key into a lock, flipping pages in a book etc. Every time you relocate or reorient 'something', it changes the ways you can apply that 'something' to 'something else'. A book moved to be open can be read, a book moved to be closed can be used as part of a stack that holds something up.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="ActivePassive">
    <h4>Active and Passive</h4>
    <p>And then also on top of this, is the Active or Passive function, which I liken it to the difference between Telling or Making (Active) something happen, and Asking or Inviting (Passive) something to happen. Because something important to remember is that Both Active and Passive classes can have the same things be the end results of their actions. They are both equally able to do the same things, but in different ways. They are equally capable, using very different methods.</p>

    <p>A) Active classes have more direct control over their aspects and how their functions interact with their aspects. They can force their aspect to do things, even things not within their aspect's natural functions. But this then comes with less intuitive understanding of how their aspect functions naturally.</p>

    <p>B) Passive classes have less direct control over their aspects, but have more intuitive insight into how their functions and aspects work in conjunction with one another naturally. They can persuade their aspect to act how it usually does, in a way that benefits them or does what they want it to do anyway.</p>

    <p>This is also the reason why inversion pairs of God Tiers exist, because for every god tier, there are 3 Actions happening, that will have 3 opposite Reactions to those actions, that would be the usual 'Actions' for an opposing god tier.</p>

    <p>And those 3 'Actions' are Function, Activity and Aspect. The Function and the Activity together create the Class, and the Aspect is on its own. For example, an Action of 'Passive Application Rage' has a Reaction of 'Active Relocation Hope'.</p>

    <p>So a Page of Rage, whenever they do their own function, unintentionally has a rebound reaction of something that looks something a Thief of Hope might have done. But this isn't to say the Page of Rage ever becomes or changes into a Thief of Hope, even when actually inverted. The function of inversion is simply when the player starts rejecting their own functions, and thus their own personality, because they think themselves and their own powers are worthless, and instead focus on their opposites, on the reactions of their powers and the opposing personality that that pushes them into, in a misguided effort to find something 'actually worthwhile' in themselves.</p>
	
	<p>Most active to most Passive(Very debatable):</p>
	
	<p>Lord ===> Thief ===> Prince ===> Witch ===> Knight ===> Maid ===> Mage -Middle- Heir ===> Bard ===> Rogue ===> Seer ===> Sylph ===> Page ===> Muse</p>
