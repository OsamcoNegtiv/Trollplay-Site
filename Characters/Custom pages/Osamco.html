</h3>
<p>
	Your land is the LAND OF TOGGLES AND FROGS. Your hive arives compressing a large button. From a distance, it looks like a BALL full of BUMPS AND TOWERS, but a closer inspection would reveal the BUMPS to be LARGE BUTTONS, and the TOWERS to be similarly sized LEVERS. Some BUTTONS contain SMALLER BUTTONS AND LEVERS on them, needing to be pressed in a particular order to press the LARGEST BUTTON. The LEVERS are simalurly designed. Making a mistake will reset all of the TOGGLES, and will asign them a new pattern. Once both of the largest TOGGLES are properly toggled, the BUTTON underneath your hive will decompress, revealing a door to the winding stairs to your DENIZEN. Unlike other Space players, your DENIZEN is OPIS. The Choice you will be presented with will be much easier, but with far less of a reward for chosing right. However, defeating OPIS grants you a much larger HOARD, and many other things s well, such as FOOD, WATER, and WEAPONS. To access the FROGS needed for breeding, you have to locate unnecessary BUTTONS, and destroy them to reveal the FROGS inside. They may or may not be dead, and due to SCHRODINGER'S LAW, you cannot breed them until they are freed.
